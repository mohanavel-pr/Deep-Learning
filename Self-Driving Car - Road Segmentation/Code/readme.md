Introduction:
This is an image segmentation task created in Kaggle for public access. In this project we will focus on “road” segmentation using the dataset created as part of Lyft Udacity Challenge. This dataset is produced via CARLA self-driving car simulator, which consists of 2 parts: actual RGB images and corresponding semantic segmented labelled images. The dataset contains 5 sets of 1000 RGB images and the segmented label images, so totally there are 10,000 images. The captured images are segmented and masked according to their category like buildings, pedestrians, poles, roads, sidewalks, walls, vehicles and etc. The main objective of this project is to build our own machine learning model to train the images and its semantic segmented images (road segment), and evaluate it by predicting the test set images.
