Introduction:

This is based on a Kaggle AI and data science competition to identify the different types of disease in Cassava leaves. 
Cassava is a widely grown crop in Sub-Saharan Africa, as it can sustain extreme climate pattern and is the 2nd largest carbohydrate source for Africa region. Even though it can withstand hot weather conditions, the major threat to these crops are viral diseases which not only affects the food supply but also has worse economic impact.

In this project, we will implement deep learning techniques to solve and help the farmers problem by identifying the correct label of the leaf out of the given 5 categories. With the help of convolutional neural network, I'd built a VGG16 model to fit in the training set leaf patterns and predict the test labels.

A custom dataset has been prepared to perform this implementation which contains 17117 training images and 4280 test images.

Training and Test dataset image filenames are available under "Dataset List" directory.
